<h3> Projects for Students </h3>

<b>Project 1: Binary Populations in Ultra Faint Dwarf Galaxies</b>

<p> Description: The orbital motion of close binary systems in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) may potentially inflate the velocity dispersions of the systems which are so far the only way to constrain the dynamical masses and therefore the dark matter content in these UFDs. This project aims to identify individual binaries in six UFDs with data collected from Magellan Telescope, and model the entire data set probabilistically to recover unbiased estimate of the velocity dispersions and the dynamical masses of the system. Read <a href=projects/UFD_binary_project.pdf>the original observing proposal</a> if you are interested in this project. </p>


<b>Project 2: A Census of the Outer Halo Star Cluster Population</b>

<p> Description: Large photometric surveys have discovered a large number of faint stellar systems in the outer halo of the Milky Way, including the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and low-luminosity star clusters. It has become increasingly difficult to distinguish between these two populations, but the distinction is crucial to robustly measure the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function. This project aims to characterize Milky Way's outer halo star clusters. Read <a href=projects/Outer_halo_cluster.pdf>the original observing proposal</a> if you are interested in this project. </p>

<b>Project 3: VLT Spectroscopy of Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies</b>

<p> Description: This project aim to perform consistent reductions and measurements for three ultra-faint dwarf galaxies using the public archival data from the GIRAFFE spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The first paper of this paper of this series has been accepted by ApJ <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00013> (here) </a> and was led by an undergraduate student (now a PhD student at MIT). Two more papers are expected from this series. A suitable project for undergrad or graduates as first research experience. </p>

<b>Project 4: Photometric metallicity with DECam and S5</b>

<p> Description: The high precision of the photometry from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) enables photometric metallicity measurements. This project aims to develop a data-driven model to connect the DECam and the spectroscopic metallicity from the  <a href=https://s5collab.github.io/> Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S5) </a>. The model could then be applied to all the globular clusters and dwarf galaxies observed by DEcam for further metallicity constraints. See Figure 12 in  <a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.490.3508L/abstract>this paper</a> if you are interested in. </p>
