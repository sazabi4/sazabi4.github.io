<h3> Projects for Students </h3>

<p> Most of the research projects listed below requires Python Programming </p>

<b>Project 1: Binary Populations in Ultra Faint Dwarf Galaxies</b>

<p> Description: The orbital motion of close binary systems in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) may potentially inflate the velocity dispersions of the systems which are so far the only way to constrain the dynamical masses and therefore the dark matter content in these UFDs. This project aims to identify individual binaries in six UFDs with data collected from Magellan Telescope, and model the entire data set probabilistically to recover unbiased estimate of the velocity dispersions and the dynamical masses of the system. Read <a href=projects/UFD_binary_project.pdf>the original observing proposal</a> if you are interested in this project. The student will learn how to reduce spectroscopic data as the first step for this project. Alternatively, the student will compile a list of binary stars in UFD with available velocity measurements and try to measure the orbital period with <a href=https://github.com/adrn/thejoker>JOKER</a>. This project could lead to a graduate student thesis project. </p>


<b>Project 2: A Census of the Outer Halo Star Cluster Population</b>

<p> Description: Large photometric surveys have discovered a large number of faint stellar systems in the outer halo of the Milky Way, including the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and low-luminosity star clusters. It has become increasingly difficult to distinguish between these two populations, but the distinction is crucial to robustly measure the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function. This project aims to characterize Milky Way's outer halo star clusters. Read <a href=projects/Outer_halo_cluster.pdf>the original observing proposal</a> if you are interested in this project. This project could also lead to additonal observing proposals led by the student. </p>

<b>Project 3: VLT Spectroscopy of Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies</b>

<p> Description: This project aim to perform consistent reductions and measurements for three ultra-faint dwarf galaxies using the public archival data from the GIRAFFE spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The first paper of this paper of this series has been accepted by ApJ <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00013> (here) </a> and was led by an undergraduate student (now a PhD student at MIT). Two more papers are expected from this series. A suitable project for undergrad or graduates as first research experience. </p>

<b>Project 4: Photometric metallicity with DECam and S5</b>

<p> Description: The high precision of the photometry from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) enables photometric metallicity measurements. This project aims to develop a data-driven model via machine learning (see <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08076>example </a>), to connect the DECam and the spectroscopic metallicity from the  <a href=https://s5collab.github.io/> Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S5) </a>. The derived model will then be applied to all the globular clusters and dwarf galaxies observed by DEcam for further metallicity constraints. See Figure 12 in  <a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.490.3508L/abstract>this paper</a> if you are interested in. </p>

<b>Project 5: Detect the LMC wake and Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage with BHBs in S5 </b>

<p> Description: <a href=https://s5collab.github.io/> Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S5) </a> has observed over 2000 BHB stars at 16 to 20 mag. This sample could be used to study the kinematics of the outer halo of the Milky Way, especially on the study of the LMC-induced sloshing of the Galactic halo (see <a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.2677E/abstract>example </a>) and the recent massive merger: Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage. </p>


<b>Project 6: Observational Forecast on Dark Matter Density Profile w/ Dwarf Galaxies </b>

<p> Description: The distribution of dark matter in dwarf galaxies can have important implications on our understanding of the particle physics properties of dark matter. In particular, the stellar kinematic data could be used to constrain the cusp or core profile of the dark matter inner halo, the so-called "cusp/core problem". This project will result in a forecast on the capability to determine the cusp/core profile with all high probable member stars selected with Gaia proper motion. See <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00613>this paper</a> for details on methodology if you are interested in. </p>

<b>I have many more projects or ideas with public or private datasets, depending on the particular science interest of the student. Schedule a meeting with me if you are interested in learning more.</b>
