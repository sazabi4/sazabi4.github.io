<p> I am currently an Assistant Professor in the <a href = https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/>Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics</a>, and an Associated Faculty Member of the <a href = https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/>Dunlap Institute</a>, at the University of Toronto (UofT).</p>

<p> Before joining the University of Toronto in 2021, I was the 2019 <a href = https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program>NASA Hubble Fellowship Program Einstein Fellow</a> at <a href=https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/>Carnegie Observatories</a>, with a joint appointment in the <a href = https://web.astro.princeton.edu/>Department of Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton University</a> as a Carnegie-Princeton Fellow.
I was a
<a href=http://fnal.gov/pub/forphysicists/fellowships/leon_lederman/index.html>Leon Lederman Fellow</a>
 at the 
<a href=http://astro.fnal.gov/>Fermilab Center for Particle Astrophysics</a> during 2016-2019. 
I earned my PhD at the
<a href=http://astrophysics.tamu.edu>Department of Physics and Astronomy</a> 
of <a href=http://www.tamu.edu>
Texas A&M University</a>.
I received the <a href=http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus_mundus/> Eramus Mundus Scholarship </a>  for
 a Joint European Master in Space Science and Technology (<a href=http://spacemaster.eu/>SpaceMaster</a>), 
during which I stayed in Germany, Sweden, France and Japan for 6 months each. 
I completed my undergraduate at <a href=http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/>Fudan University</a>  in Shanghai, China,
 with a major in Physics and a minor in Diplomacy.
</p>

<p>
My research focuses on near-field cosmology. In particular, I study stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and nearby galaxies to understand how they form and to understand the nature of dark matter. I position myself as a traditional observational astrophysicist immersed in modern sky surveys with petabytes of data, using deep targeted follow-up astronomical observations to leverage the exploration of large-scale cosmic survey data. So far, I have spent over 300 nights on various optical telescopes all over the world.
</p>

<p>
I have been involved in many large-area sky surveys such as <a href=http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/>the Dark Energy Survey (DES)</a>, <a href=https://www.desi.lbl.gov/>Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)</a> Survey. I was the chair of the DES Milky Way Working Group in 2018-2021. I am currently the chair of the DESI Milky Way Survey Working Group. Furthermore, I am the founder and leader of  <a href=https://s5collab.github.io/>the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey</a>, or S5, a survey to map streams of stars in the sky visible from the southern hemisphere to determine the mass profile of the Milky Way. I am also the Dark Matter Working Group co-chairs of <a href=https://mse.cfht.hawaii.edu/>the Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer</a>, a 11.25-meter telescope facility dedicated to the next generation spectroscopic surveys.
</p>

<p>
Apart from the science interest, I am also an instrument builder. 
During my postdoc, I was actively involved in the <a href=https://www.desi.lbl.gov/>Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)</a> Survey.
In particular, I am building the focus and alignment system for DESI, which is an essential component for the survey commissioning and operation.
In my graduate school, I worked in the
 <a href=http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/>Munnerlyn Astronomical Instrumentation Lab</a>, where I helped design and built
  the auxiliary calibration systems, namely
<a href=http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/aTmCam.html> aTmCam</a> and <a href=http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/DeCal.html>DECal</a>,
for DES, which are used to improve the precision of the photometric calibration to better than 1%.
I have also worked on a few other instrumentation projects, such as the <a href=http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/gmt.html>Giant Magellan Telescope</a>
and the <a href=http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/hetdex.html>HETDEX project</a>, etc. 
</p>


<h3>For Students </h3>

<p> If you are interested in learning more about my research field in dwarf galaxies, here are some good articles for beginners: <a href=DwarfGalaxies2021_NatAst.pdf>Dwarf galaxies yesterday, now and tomorrow</a> (by Denija Crnojević and Burçin Mutlu-Pakdil), <a href=DwarfGalaxies2021_PhyToday.pdf>Illuminating the
    Darkest Galaxies</a> (Joshua Simon and Marla Geha). I also highly recommend <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.4686.pdf>this article</a> by Hogg, Bovy & Lang on how to "fitting a model to data". </p>

<p> In addition, you may want to watch the following talks I've given recently: Colloquium at UofT Physics Department <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jYWHJsie4o>From Telescopes to Dark Matter & Black Holes</a>, Seminar at Texas A&M University  <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxIvjkveESA>Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S5):
    Overview and Latest Science Results</a>. I also recently gave a talk at AAS's DDA Community seminar. The first half is a science talk and the second half is is on the topic of barriers for international students studying in the U.S. You are welcome to watch it <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0t-6Fy3vSk>here</a>. </p>

<p> I have several <a href=projects.html>research projects</a> suitable for undergrad and/or beginning graduate students at UofT, either through Supervised Courses or Summer Programs at UofT. Feel free to send me an email if you are interested in. I am always happy to talk to the students if there is anything you wish to discuss or chat about, e.g. research, teaching, career development, etc. Feel free to either shoot me an email, or message me on the UofT Astro Slack.</p>
