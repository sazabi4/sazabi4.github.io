I am the 
<a href=http://fnal.gov/pub/forphysicists/fellowships/leon_lederman/index.html>Leon Lederman Fellow</a>
 at the 
<a href=http://astro.fnal.gov/>Fermilab Center for Particle Astrophysics</a>. 
</p>


Before joining Fermilab, I was a graduate student in the 
<a href=http://astrophysics.tamu.edu>Department of Physics and Astronomy</a> 
at <a href=http://www.tamu.edu> 
Texas A&M University</a>.
I received the <a href=http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus_mundus/> Eramus Mundus Scholarship </a>  for
 a Joint European Master in Space Science and Technology (<a href=http://spacemaster.eu/>SpaceMaster</a>), 
during which I stayed in Germany, Sweden, France and Japan for 6 months each. 
I completed my undergraduate at <a href=http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/>Fudan University</a>  in Shanghai, China,
 with a major in Physics and a minor in Diplomacy.
</p>

<p>
I'm an observational astrophysicist, mostly working on near-field cosmology, Galactic archaeology, and metal-poor stars.
My main interest is to study the Milky Way halo and use that to understand the formation history of the Milky Way and the nature of dark matter.
In particular, I search for interesting substructures in our local Universe, including the stellar streams and dwarf galaxies, use modern imaging surveys 
such as the <a href=http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/>Dark Energy Survey (DES)</a>. After finding them,  I also follow up the stars in the streams
and galaxies to study their kinematic and chemical properties, using large optical telescopes all over the world. 
</p>

<p>
Apart from the science interest, I am also an instrument builder. 
During my postdoc, I am actively involved in the <a href=https://www.desi.lbl.gov/>Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)</a> Survey.
In particular, I am building the focus and alignment system for DESI, which is an essential component for the survey commissioning and operation.
In my graduate school, I worked with in the
 <a href=http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/>Munnerlyn Astronomical Instrumentation Lab</a>, where I helped design and built
  the auxiliary calibration systems, namely
<a href=http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/aTmCam.html> aTmCam</a> and <a href=http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/DeCal.html>DECal</a>,
for DES, which are used to improve the precision of the photometric calibration to better than 1%.
I have also worked on a few other instrumentation projects, such as the <a href=http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/gmt.html>Giant Magellan Telescope</a>
and the <a href=http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/hetdex.html>HETDEX project</a>, etc.
