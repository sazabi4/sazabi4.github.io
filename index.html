<p> I am currently an Assistant Professor in the <a href = https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/>Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics</a>, and an Associated Faculty Member of the <a href = https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/>Dunlap Institute</a>, at the University of Toronto.</p>

<p> Before joining the University of Toronto in 2021, I was the 2019 <a href = https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program>NASA Hubble Fellow</a> at <a href=https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/>Carnegie Observatories</a>, with a joint appointment in the <a href = https://web.astro.princeton.edu/>Department of Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton University</a> as a Carnegie-Princeton Fellow.
I was a
<a href=http://fnal.gov/pub/forphysicists/fellowships/leon_lederman/index.html>Leon Lederman Fellow</a>
 at the 
<a href=http://astro.fnal.gov/>Fermilab Center for Particle Astrophysics</a> during 2016-2019. 
I earned my PhD at the
<a href=http://astrophysics.tamu.edu>Department of Physics and Astronomy</a> 
of <a href=http://www.tamu.edu>
Texas A&M University</a>.
I received the <a href=http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus_mundus/> Eramus Mundus Scholarship </a>  for
 a Joint European Master in Space Science and Technology (<a href=http://spacemaster.eu/>SpaceMaster</a>), 
during which I stayed in Germany, Sweden, France and Japan for 6 months each. 
I completed my undergraduate at <a href=http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/>Fudan University</a>  in Shanghai, China,
 with a major in Physics and a minor in Diplomacy.
</p>

<p>
I'm an observational astrophysicist working on near-field cosmology, Galactic archaeology, and metal-poor stars.
My main interest is to study the Milky Way halo and use that to understand the formation history of the Milky Way and the nature of dark matter.
In particular, I study interesting substructures in our local Universe, including stellar streams and dwarf galaxies, with modern imaging surveys
such as the <a href=http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/>Dark Energy Survey (DES)</a>. After finding them,  I follow up the stars in the streams
and galaxies to study their kinematic and chemical properties, using large optical telescopes all over the world. 
In Summer 2018, I initiated the <a href=https://s5collab.github.io/>Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey</a>, or S5, to map the kinematics and chemistry of stellar streams in the Southern Hemisphere. I was the convenor of the DES Milky Way Working Group in 2018-2021.
</p>

<p>
Apart from the science interest, I am also an instrument builder. 
During my postdoc, I was actively involved in the <a href=https://www.desi.lbl.gov/>Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)</a> Survey.
In particular, I am building the focus and alignment system for DESI, which is an essential component for the survey commissioning and operation.
In my graduate school, I worked in the
 <a href=http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/>Munnerlyn Astronomical Instrumentation Lab</a>, where I helped design and built
  the auxiliary calibration systems, namely
<a href=http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/aTmCam.html> aTmCam</a> and <a href=http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/DeCal.html>DECal</a>,
for DES, which are used to improve the precision of the photometric calibration to better than 1%.
I have also worked on a few other instrumentation projects, such as the <a href=http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/gmt.html>Giant Magellan Telescope</a>
and the <a href=http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/hetdex.html>HETDEX project</a>, etc. 
</p>


<h3>For Graduate and Undergraduate Students</h3>

<p> I have several research projects suitable for the students at UofT, either through Supervised Courses or the Summer Programs at UofT. Feel free to send me an email if you are interested in. I am always happy to talk to the students if there is anything you wish to discuss or chat about, e.g. research, teaching, career development, etc. Feel free to either shoot me an email, or message me on the UofT Astro Slack.</p>
